# 30s Demo Script (Spoken)

"Hi, this is mama-ai. In hackathons, teams lose time wiring infrastructure
instead of proving ideas. mama-ai fixes that. Out of the box, you get a CLI,
an API, and a web UI running a real sentiment model. You can flip between
Hugging Face, Gemini, and a local heuristic backend with a single dropdown.
If a dependency fails, mama-ai falls back automatically so the demo never
crashes. This lets you spend your time on the idea, not the boilerplate."
