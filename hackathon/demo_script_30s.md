# 30s Demo Script (Spoken)

"Hi, this is mama-ai. In hackathons, everyone loses time wiring infra instead of proving ideas.
mama-ai fixes that. Out of the box, you get three things:
a CLI for quick experiments, an API for integrations, and a UI to demo to judges.
Behind this simple demo, the structure is ready for real models, data, and evaluations.
So instead of spending a day on boilerplate, you plug in your model and ship in under an hour."
