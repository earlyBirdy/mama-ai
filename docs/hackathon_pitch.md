# mama-ai – Hackathon Pitch (Text Draft)

Problem:
- Many teams need a quick way to prototype AI workflows without spending days wiring infra.

Solution:
- mama-ai is a thin, opinionated starter that gives you:
  - A CLI, API, and UI in a single repo.
  - Clear folders for models, data, and notebooks.
  - Ready-to-extend hooks for real inference.

Why now:
- Hackathons and POCs need working demos in hours, not weeks.
- This repo makes it trivial to plug in your own model and ship.
